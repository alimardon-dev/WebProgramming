This lesson is about OOP concepts
// Big 4 concepts: Abstraction & Encapsulation & Inheritance & Polymorphism
// Object built via literal method
// Primitive and Object Variables
// object has reference and value while primitive has only value

At first when we create it is called CLASS
then when we make an object using it it is called INSTANCE
